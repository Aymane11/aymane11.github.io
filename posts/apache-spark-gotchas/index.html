It’s a popular choice for many organizations due to its ability to scale and its support for a wide range of programming languages. However, like any complex system, there are a few gotchas that users should be aware of when working with Spark. In this post, I will cover some of the most common gotchas that I learned while working with Spark, it will also be a sort of summary of some concepts I read about in the Learning Spark: Lightning-Fast Big Data Analysis book (link).\nLazy Evaluation Spark uses a technique called lazy evaluation to optimize the processing of RDDs. This means that transformations on RDDs are not actually executed until an action (e.g., show, count, collect, take) is called on them. This can lead to confusion, as it is not always clear when a transformation will be executed. For example, when timing a transformation, it is important to note that the transformation will not be executed until an action is called, so there is no point in timing the transformation instruction itself.\nval bigDf = ... val transformed = bigDf.filter(...).map(...) // this transformation will not be executed yet (lazy evaluation) transformed.count() // this action will trigger the execution of the transformation and will take more time than the transformation itself Joins Join strategies There are two main strategies for performing joins in Spark: broadcast joins and shuffle joins. The strategy used depends (not only) on the size of the dataframes being joined, and Spark will automatically choose the best strategy. However, it is important to understand how each strategy works to avoid unexpected behavior.\nBroadcast joins Broadcast joins are used when one of the dataframes being joined is small enough to fit in memory (10MB by default). Spark will send a copy of the small dataframe to all nodes in the cluster (hence the name broadast join), and then perform the join locally on each node. This is generally faster than a shuffle join, but it can lead to out of memory errors if the dataframe is too large. Shuffle joins In shuffle joins, Spark will shuffle the dataframes partitions between nodes, to ensure that all data with the same key is on the same node. This is generally slower than a broadcast join because of all the shuffling that occurs, but it can be used to join dataframes of any size. See: Spark Join Strategies - How \u0026 What? and The art of joining in Spark\nDuplicate columns after joins An issue that I faced multiple times when working with Spark is having duplicate columns after performing a join between two dataframes having the same join column name.\nval left = Seq((\"John\", \"Doe\", 29), (\"Aymane\", \"Boumaaza\", 20), (\"Jane\", \"Doe\", 29) ).toDF(\"firstname\", \"lastname\", \"age\") // +---------+--------+---+ // |firstname|lastname|age| // +---------+--------+---+ // | John| Doe| 29| // | Aymane|Boumaaza| 20| // | Jane| Doe| 29| // +---------+--------+---+ val right = Seq((\"John\"), (\"Aymane\"), (\"Jane\")).toDF(\"firstname\") // +---------+ // |firstname| // +---------+ // | John| // | Aymane| // | Jane| // +---------+ val joined = left.join(right, left(\"firstname\") === right(\"firstname\")) // +---------+--------+---+---------+ // |firstname|lastname|age|firstname| // Notice the duplicate column (firstname) // +---------+--------+---+---------+ // | John| Doe| 29| John| // | Aymane|Boumaaza| 20| Aymane| // | Jane| Doe| 29| Jane| // +---------+--------+---+---------+ When performing a join in Spark, use a list/sequence as the by parameter to avoid duplicate columns to ensure that the resulting dataframe only has a single copy of each column.\nval joined = left.join(right, Seq(\"firstname\")) // or val joined = left.join(right, \"firstname\") if using only one column to join // +---------+--------+---+ // |firstname|lastname|age| // +---------+--------+---+ // | John| Doe| 29| // | Aymane|Boumaaza| 20| // | Jane| Doe| 29| // +---------+--------+---+ See: Databricks - Prevent duplicated columns when joining two DataFrames\nWriting to files Filenames When writing to file in Spark, it is important to note that the output will be written to a directory, not a single file. This is because each partition is written to a separate file, and the files are combined into a single directory. It is important to keep this in mind when specifying the output path, as adding a .csv extension to the path will create a directory with the name filename.csv rather than a single file, therefore there’s no need to add the extension (since it’s a directory).\nval df = Seq((\"John\", \"Doe\", \"29\"), (\"Aymane\", \"Boumaaza\", \"20\"), (\"Jane\", \"Doe\", \"29\") ).toDF(\"firstname\", \"lastname\", \"age\") df.write.csv(\"/tmp/my_csv.csv\") df.write.parquet(\"/tmp/my_parquet.parquet\") /tmp/my_csv.csv and /tmp/my_parquet.parquet will be both directories containing the actual csv and parquet files.\n$ ls -l /tmp drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jan 4 20:20 my_csv.csv drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jan 4 20:20 my_parquet.parquet Number of partitions When writing to file in Apache Spark, it’s important to consider the number of partitions in your data. The more partitions you have, the more files are created. This can be beneficial if you are working with a large dataset and want to parallelize the writing process. However, if you have a small dataset, using too many partitions can lead to unnecessary overhead and slower performance, and vice versa when working with large dataframes and having small number of partitions will result in less files but bigger ones. It is important to carefully consider the size and structure of your dataset when deciding on the number of partitions to use.\nSmall DataFrame Minimize the number of partitions to avoid unnecessary overhead.\nval smallDf = Seq((\"John\", \"Doe\", \"29\"), (\"Aymane\", \"Boumaaza\", \"20\"), (\"Jane\", \"Doe\", \"29\") ).toDF(\"firstname\", \"lastname\", \"age\") smallDf.rdd.partitions.size // Int = 3 smallDf.write.csv(\"/tmp/output\") // /tmp/output will be a directory containing 3 (number of partitions) csv files smallDf.coalesce(1).write.csv(\"/tmp/output\") // or repartition(1) // /tmp/output will be a directory containing a single csv file (with other files) Big DataFrame Use a reasonable number of partitions to have manageable output.\nval bigDf = ... bigDf.rdd.partitions.size // Int = 200 bigDf.write.csv(\"/tmp/output\") // /tmp/output.csv will be a directory containing 200 (number of partitions) csv files bigDf.coalesce(10).write.csv(\"/tmp/output\") // or repartition(10) // /tmp/output.csv will be a directory containing 10 csv files which is more manageable than 200 files Write Options When saving a dataframe to file in Spark, it is important to consider the various options available to you. For example, the header option controls whether the column names are included in the output csv file. By default, this option is set to false, which means that header containing the column names will not be included. It is important to carefully consider the options available to you when writing to file to ensure that the output is in the desired format.\nval df = Seq((\"John\", \"Doe\", \"29\"), (\"Aymane\", \"Boumaaza\", \"20\"), (\"Jane\", \"Doe\", \"29\") ).toDF(\"firstname\", \"lastname\", \"age\") df.write.csv(\"/tmp/output\") // header is false by default df.write.option(\"header\",true).option(\"delimiter\",\"|\").csv(\"/tmp/output\") See Spark SQL - Data Source\nPySpark UDFs vs Pandas UDFs When working with User-Defined Functions (UDFs) in PySpark (2.3+), it is often more efficient to use Pandas UDFs (also known as vectorized UDFs) instead of standard Spark UDFs. Because PySpark UDFs require data movement between the JVM and Python, which is expensive, Pandas UDFs allow you to process the data using the power of vectorization and Apache Arrow. This can significantly improve the performance of your Spark application.\nimport pandas as pd from pyspark.sql.types import StringType from pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf, udf df = spark.createDataFrame( data=[ (\"Aymane\", \"Boumaaza\", 20), (\"John\", \"Doe\", 30), (\"Jane\", \"Doe\", 40), ], schema=[\"firstname\", \"lastname\", \"age\"], ) # Standard UDF @udf(returnType=StringType()) def fullname(firstname, lastname): return f\"{firstname.capitalize()} {lastname.upper()}\" df.withColumn(\"fullname\", fullname(\"firstname\", \"lastname\")) # Pandas UDF @pandas_udf(StringType()) def fullname_pd(firstname: pd.Series, lastname: pd.Series) -\u003e pd.Series: # You can use any of the pandas APIs here return firstname.str.capitalize() + \" \" + lastname.str.upper() df.withColumn(\"fullname\", fullname_pd(\"firstname\", \"lastname\")) cache vs persist In Spark, you can use the cache and persist functions to store data in memory for faster access. However, there are some important differences between these two functions. The persist function allows you to specify the storage level (e.g., memory only, memory and disk, etc.), while the cache function stores data in the default storage level MEMORY_AND_DISK, first Spark tries to store the dataframe in memory, if there’s any excess, it will be stored in disk. It is important to choose the appropriate function based on your use case. The choice of storage level is crucial as it can have a significant impact on the performance of your Spark application.\nNote from the Learning Spark: Lightning-Fast Big Data Analysis book:\nWhen you use cache() or persist(), the DataFrame is not fully cached until you invoke an action that goes through every record (e.g., count()). If you use an action like take(1), only one partition will be cached because Catalyst realizes that you do not need to compute all the partitions just to retrieve one record.\nConclusion Most of the topics I covered in this article were introduced to me in the Learning Spark: Lightning-Fast Big Data Analysis book, that I highly recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about Spark, it’s a great resource to know more about Spark. I hope you found this article useful, if you have any questions or comments, please reach out.

However, there are some important differences between these two functions. The persist function allows you to specify the storage level (e.g., memory only, memory and disk, etc.), while the <code>cache</code> function stores data in the default storage level <code>MEMORY_AND_DISK</code>, first Spark tries to store the dataframe in memory, if there&rsquo;s any excess, it will be stored in disk. It is important to choose the appropriate function based on your use case. The choice of storage level is crucial as it can have a significant impact on the performance of your Spark application.</p><p><strong>Note from the <a href=https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/LearningSpark2.0.pdf>Learning Spark: Lightning-Fast Big Data Analysis</a> book:</strong></p><blockquote><p>When you use cache() or persist(), the DataFrame is not fully cached until you invoke an action that goes through every record (e.g., count()). If you use an action like take(1), only one partition will be cached because Catalyst realizes that you do not need to compute all the partitions just to retrieve one record.</p></blockquote><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#conclusion>#</a></h1><p>Most of the topics I covered in this article were introduced to me in the <a href=https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/LearningSpark2.0.pdf>Learning Spark: Lightning-Fast Big Data Analysis</a> book, that I highly recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about Spark, it&rsquo;s a great resource to know more about Spark.
